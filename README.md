# Blinkdown
## A Free, Accessible Markdown Editor
### What Is It?

*Blinkdown* aims to be a simple, accessible, standard Windows desktop app that allows you to easily create CommonMark files and preview the resulting HTML.

### What Can It Do?

* Live Markdown preview: Start typing, then press F6 to focus a standard web browser control to view the resultant HTML. (Press F6 again to return to the editor control.)
* Standard menu bar.
* Open and save files.
* Prompt the user to save changes on exit.

### What *Can't* it do?

* Most menu options are unimplemented.
* No WYSIWYG tools for formatting
* No copy, paste, or undo.

### Building

This project requires Visual Studio 2015 (community or better) edition to build. It depends on CommonMark.net, which should automagically be pulled in by NuGet.
